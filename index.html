                Born in South Korea, and raised in Canada for <em>half of my life</em>,
                I am enrolled in Computer Information Technology at BCIT starting this semester.
                As someone with a <strong>Bachelorâ€™s degree in Criminology</strong> beforehand,
                becoming a student once again is by far the most thrilling and nostalgic experience during the past
                few years.
            </p>
            <p>
                Following the graduation from the university, I joined the army in South Korea to complete my
                compulsory military service. Being enlisted in the service literally <em>two months after completing my
                    degree</em> was not entirely pleasant in terms of adapting to a rigid and inflexible nature of the
                military organization.
                Yet, the twenty-one months of military service was certainly valuable, as I was able to do inner
                reflections of myself
                and to adapt to cultures in the motherland.
            </p>
            <p>
                With all knowledge and skills that I built up during my service and previous education,
                I moved back to Canada in 2019 and gained work experiences to obtain the permanent residence status.
                Finally, I recently achieved one of the most important goals in my life in <strong>January2021</strong>
                and started to study at BCIT as a domestic student.
