        <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
        <div class="paraone">
        <p>
            Born in South Korea, and raised in Canada for <em>half of my life</em>,
            I am enrolled in Computer Information Technology at BCIT starting this semester.
            As someone with a <strong>Bachelorâ€™s degree in Criminology</strong> beforehand,
            becoming a student once again is by far the most thrilling and nostalgic experience during the past
            few years.

            Following the graduation from the university, I joined the army in South Korea to complete my
            compulsory military service. Being enlisted in the service literally <em>two months after completing my
            degree</em> was not entirely pleasant in terms of adapting to a rigid and inflexible nature of the
            military organization.
            Yet, the twenty-one months of military service was certainly valuable, as I was able to do inner
            reflections of myself
            and to adapt to cultures in the motherland.
        </p>

        <div class="parathree">
        <p>
            With all knowledge and skills that I built up during my service and previous education,
            I moved back to Canada in 2019 and gained work experiences to obtain the permanent residence status.
            Finally, I recently achieved one of the most important goals in my life in <strong>January2021</strong>
            and started to study at BCIT as a domestic student.
