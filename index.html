    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
        Born in South Korea, and raised in Canada for <em>half of my life</em>,
        I am enrolled in Computer Information Technology at BCIT starting this semester.
        As someone with a <strong>Bachelorâ€™s degree in Criminology</strong> beforehand,
        becoming a student once again is by far the most thrilling and nostalgic experience during the past few years.
        Following the graduation from the university, I joined the army in South Korea to complete my compulsory
        military service.
        Being enlisted in the service literally <em>two months after completing my degree</em> was not entirely pleasant
        in terms of adapting to a rigid and inflexible nature of the military organization.
        Yet, the twenty-one months of military service was certainly valuable,
        as I was able to do inner reflections of myself and to adapt to cultures in the motherland.
        With all knowledge and skills that I built up during my service and previous education,
        I moved back to Canada in 2019 and gained work experiences to obtain the permanent residence status.
        Finally, I recently achieved one of the most important goals in my life in <strong>January 2021</strong> and started to study at
        BCIT as a domestic student.
